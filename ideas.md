The Start up ideas: 

1. Anoynomus suggestions (which somehow aren't actually anoynomus and and we can see who posts them)
2. 

### The Web
## Search bar
# ~~get to work for double names~~
# find near matches and display in failure alert

## Legend
# allow ability to click on legend to only show those connections
# allow to work for different combos (have all set to on as default, click to turn off)
# can use cy.remove() to remove by cy.filter(). remove returns all removed values and can be restored using cy.restore() 

Goals:

1. Get contacted by the presitent of British Orineteering Federation (Tom Bray) asking for an apology just like how Sam G did when he touched a girl up.
