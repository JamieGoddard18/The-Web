The Start up ideas: 

1. Anoynomus suggestions (which somehow aren't actually anoynomus and and we can see who posts them)
2. 

### The Web
## Search bar
# get to work for double names
# find near matches and display in failure alert

Goals:

1. Get contacted by the presitent of British Orineteering Federation (Tom Bray) asking for an apology just like how Sam G did when he touched a girl up.
